                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Achieving consistent encoding within a given community of practice has been a recurrent issue for the TEI Guidelines. The topic is of particular importance for lexical data if we
                    think of the potential wealth of content we could gain from pooling together the information available in the variety of highly structured, historical and contemporary lexical
                    resources. Still, the encoding possibilities offered by the Dictionaries Chapter in the Guidelines are too numerous and too flexible to guarantee sufficient interoperability and a
                    coherent model for searching, visualising or enriching multiple lexical resources.</p>
                <p>Following the spirit of TEI Analytics [Zillig, 2009], developed in the context of the MONK project, <hi rend="bold">TEI Lex-0</hi> aims at establishing a baseline encoding and a
                    target format to facilitate the interoperability of heterogeneously encoded lexical resources. This is important both in the context of building lexical infrastructures as such
                    [Ermolaev and Tasovac, 2012] and in the context of developing generic TEI-aware tools such as dictionary viewers and profilers. T</p>
                <p>TEI Lex-0 should not be thought of as a replacement of the Dictionary Chapter in the TEI Guidelines or as the format that must be used for editing or managing individual resources,
                    especially in those projects and/or institutions that already have established workflows based on their own flavors of TEI. TEI Lex-0 should be primarily seen as a format that
                    existing TEI dictionaries can be univocally transformed to in order to be queried, visualised, or mined in a uniform way. At the same time, however, there is no reason why TEI
                    Lex-0 could not or should not be used as a best-practice example in educational settings or as a set of best-practice guidelines for new TEI-based projects, especially considering
                    the fact that in TEI Lex-0 we aimed to stay as aligned as possible with the TEI subset developed in conjunction with the revision of the ISO LMF (Lexical Markup Framework) standard
                    (cf. [Romary, 2015])</p>

                    <p>Preliminary work for the establishment of TEI Lex-0 started in the Working Group "Retrodigitised Dictionaries" lead by Toma Tasovac and Vera Hildenbrandt as part of the COST
                        Action <ref target="http://www.elexicography.eu">European Network of e-Lexicography</ref> (ENeL). Upon the completion of the COST Action, the work on TEI Lex-0 was taken up by
                        the DARIAH Working Group "Lexical Resources" which is co-chaired by Laurent Romary and Toma Tasovac. Currently, the work on TEI Lex-0 is conducted by the DARIAH WG "Lexical
                        Resources" and the H2020-funded <ref target="https://elex.is">European Lexicographic Infrastructure</ref> (ELEXIS). </p>

                    <head>Dictionary model vs. XML serialization</head>
                    <p>A fundamental principle that the present enterprise relies on is the nature of the mapping of the physical or “near-physical” (OCR-ed) dictionary contents onto the abstract
                        model of a dictionary structure, and the mapping from said model onto its (in our case) TEI XML serialization. It is important to keep in mind the distinction between the
                        abstract model and its serialization because, as we shall see, the TEI uses the same elements of the abstract model to serve many kinds of text-modelling tasks, and standardly
                        employs ‘features’ or ‘facets’ of these elements (known in the XML world as attributes) to express differences among them. The fact that some elements of the serialization have
                        names closely corresponding to what we can customarily find in the dictionary model is more or less a lucky coincidence. It is not the pattern to be expected. A lexicographer
                        coming from outside of the TEI universe should not necessarily expect his or her customary terms (names of dictionary objects in the dictionary model) to be straightforwardly
                        reflected in the TEI vocabulary names.</p>
                    <p>Take, for instance, the TEI element <gi>cit</gi>. Originally, its TEI name came from the word “citation” and this is what the element was used for up to the early days of TEI
                        P5, when it acquired a new, broader function of grouping together pieces of text perceived or broadly treated as “foreign” or additional, together with their (bibliographic,
                        linguistic, or usage-oriented) description. This element is nowadays used as a “container” for citations, dictionary examples, translation equivalents etc. The value of the
                        attribute <att>type</att> is used to further specify the kind of cit-object at hand. In our case, four distinct names of dictionary objects in the abstract dictionary model
                        (namely, “citation”, “example”, “translation” (of quotes) and “translation equivalent” (of words) map onto four distinct element+attribute combinations in the TEI XML
                        serialization (respectively, <gi>cit</gi> with <att>type</att>="citation", <gi>cit</gi> with <att>type</att>="example", and <gi>cit</gi> with <att>type</att>="translation" or
                            <att>type</att>="translationEquivalent".</p>
                    <p>The following example from a bilingual dictionary, shows how one typed element – <gi>cit</gi> – can be used to encode different parts of the dictionary structure:</p>

                    <p>In the current <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>, the TEI defines four different container elements that may serve as grouping devices for lexical information on the level of
                        entries (the following definitions are taken from the TEI guidelines, emphasis added):</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item><gi>entry</gi>: contains a single <hi rend="italic">structured entry</hi> in any kind of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon.</item>
                        <item><gi>entryFree</gi>: contains a single <hi rend="italic">unstructured entry</hi> in any kind of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon.</item>
                        <item><gi>superEntry</gi>: groups a sequence of entries within any kind of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon which function as a single unit, for example a set
                            of homographs.</item>
                        <item><gi>re</gi>: (related entry) contains a dictionary entry for a lexical item related to the headword, such as a compound phrase or derived form, embedded inside a larger
                            entry.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>These four elements can be used to distinguish types of entries along two conceptual axes:</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Containing vs. contained entries</hi>: entries may contain additional lexical information that can be conceived as an additional dictionary entry in its
                            own right. Specifically, <gi>superEntry</gi> may contain <gi>entry</gi> and <gi>entry</gi> in turn may contain <gi>re</gi> to represent the embedding of lexical entries on
                            three distinct levels. Due to <gi>re</gi> being allowed to be used recursively, the number of levels for representing entry-like lexical information inside other such
                            blocks is effectively unrestricted.</item>
                        <item><hi rend="bold">Structured vs. unstructured entries</hi>, i. e. entries that can readily be represented (in the lexical view) in the spirit of the TEI Guideline’s
                            Dictionary Chapter (<gi>entry</gi>, <gi>re</gi>) vs. entries that for some reason violate the generic content model of <gi>entry</gi> or <gi>re</gi> and thus have to be
                            represented more freely (<gi>entryFree</gi>). A third category in this respect are entries that exhibit a highly reduced amount of lexical content while this content is
                            still of essentially entry-like nature (<gi>superEntry</gi>).</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In TEI Lex-0, we refrain from this overly complex cross-classification of entries with regard to their place within an entry hierarchy (first axis above) and the rigidity of the
                        lexical structuring they exhibit (second axis above). Instead of using four different elements for entry-like objects, only <gi>entry</gi> is used. In order to still be able to
                        construct hierarchies of embedded entries, <gi>entry</gi> is in the context of TEI Lex-0 allowed to occur recursively (e.g. by making it part of <ref
                            target="#TEI.model.entryPart.top">model.entryPart.top</ref>). This is where TEI Lex-0 departs from the TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>, but this <ref
                            target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1791">issue</ref> has already been raised with TEI. </p>
                    <p>In the context of TEI-Lex-0, <gi>entry</gi> is used to encode the basic element of the dictionary microstructure; it groups all the information related to a particular
                        linguistic entity and may contain further entries related to it (e.g. homographs or compound phrases).</p>
                    <p>The substitution of <gi>re</gi> and <gi>superEntry</gi> by <gi>entry</gi> is compatible with regard to the content model of the discarded elements. Both <gi>re</gi> and
                            <gi>superEntry</gi> have content models that are proper subsets of the content model of <gi>entry</gi>. Instead of <gi>superEntry</gi> which most typically is used as a
                        mere container for grouping lexical entries, either an <gi>entry</gi> grouping entries can be used or the mechanisms implemented by <ref target="#TEI.att.global.linking"
                            >att.global.linking </ref> can be exploited.</p>
                    <p>Consider the following excerpt from the “Wörterbuch der deutschen Gegenwartssprache” (“Dictionary of Contemporary German”, WDG, 1964–1977). In the WDG, compounds with the same
                        morphological dependant (but different heads) are grouped into nests. According to the current TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>, such a nest would most probably be
                        serialized as follows:</p>

                        serves as part of the access structure for the idioms. This can also be modelled using recursive entries. Again, see <ref target="#TypesOfEntries">Types of entries</ref> for a

                        the TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi> for <gi>entry</gi>, <gi>dictScrap</gi> within <gi>entry</gi> shall be used.</p>

                    <p>In TEI Lex-0, <gi>entry</gi> may contain the following elements: <gi>form</gi>, <gi>sense</gi>, <gi>entry</gi>, <gi>etym</gi>, <gi>gramGrp</gi>, <gi>usg</gi>, <gi>xr</gi>,
                            <gi>pc</gi>, and <gi>dictScrap</gi>. Contrary to the current TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>, it may not directly contain the following elements: <gi>def</gi>,
                            <gi>hom</gi>, and <gi>cit</gi>. See the section <ref target="#hp8vymhe6byi"><hi>Towards a more systematic use of <gi>sense</gi></hi></ref> below.</p>
                    <p>In TEI Lex-0, <gi>entry</gi> has a mandatory <att>xml:id</att> attribute.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, in TEI Lex-0, <gi>entry</gi> has a mandatory <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. This may appear superflous considering XML inheritance rules: in TEI proper, one would
                        use an <att>xml:lang</att> attribute on the <gi>text</gi> element or even the root <gi>TEI</gi> element to indicate the source language of the dictioanry and assume that the
                        value of the attribute will be inherited by all the entries. In TEI Lex-0, we err on the side of overexplicitness in order to guarantee the global autonomy of the entry as a
                        core element of the dictionary macrostructure. </p>

                    <p>Based on the proposed definition for <gi>entry</gi> in TEI-Lex-0, entries are conceived as “the most basic” elements of the microstructure. The examples provided in the section
                            <ref target="#3rsjyvcjjmqz"><hi>Unified representation of entries</hi></ref> illustrate two applications of entries embedded within entries and make it obvious that
                        different types of linguistic entities can be represented by <gi>entry</gi> in one single dictionary. Therefore, the provision of a <att>type</att> attribute for <gi>entry</gi>
                        is encouraged in such cases. The value for the type attribute shall denote a property of the entry as a whole that is not represented more specifically by way of other elements
                        within the entry. It is for example <hi rend="italic">not</hi> good practice to use the part-of-speech as the value for entry/@type because this information is encoded in
                        gramGrp/pos.</p>
                    <p>The current TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi> suggest the set of the following values for <att>type</att>:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>abbr</item>
                        <item>affix</item>
                        <item>foreign</item>
                        <item>hom</item>
                        <item>main</item>
                        <item>sub</item>
                        <item>supplemental</item>
                        <item>xref</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Again, the list of values represent features from a considerable range of axes. Moreover, the features are not mutually exclusive (e.g. a foreign abbreviation may well be a
                        homonym). The values belong to different domains: morphology (abbr), etymology (foreign), orthography and possibly phonology (hom), and (in a broad sense) the macrostructure of
                        the dictionary (main, supplemental, xr). Of these domains, all except the dictionary’s macrostructure are catered for in specific elements below the level of the entry. They
                        should therefore not be used as types of entries.</p>
                    <p>In general, the entry type can be applied locally for a single dictionary or globally to allow for classification across different dictionaries. Provided that a single
                        dictionary will often comprise entries that describe linguistic entities of the same kind (“words”, word families, multi-word expressions, morphemes, …) a classification along
                        those lines will be of minor importance for a stand-alone resource but may be useful in a multi-dictionary use-case. Possible values for this domain include:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>affix</item>
                        <item>word</item>
                        <item>synset</item>
                        <item>multi-word-entity</item>
                        <item>word-family</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>A classification based on macrostructural properties (i. e. properties describing aspects of the internal organisation of a resource) can on the other hand be exploited both for
                        a single dictionary and across different dictionaries. Possible values for this domain include:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>main</item>
                        <item>supplemental</item>

                    <head>General remarks</head>
                    <p>In the current TEI Dictionary Chapter, the content model of <gi>entry</gi> allows one to have sense-related information directly within <gi>entry</gi>. TEI Lex-0 proscribes a
                        stricter use of these elements so that sense-related information is grouped within the <gi>sense</gi> element, in accordance with the underlying semasiological model
                        implemented in the TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>.</p>
                    <p><gi>sense</gi> should be therefore considered mandatory for any dictionary entry that actually provides sense information for the headword. Further in this document, we consider
                        some additional specific cases e.g. “referencing” entries (entires that simply point to other entries) and inflexional lexica (dictionaries that describe word forms only),
                        where <gi>sense</gi> is not a mandatory child of <gi>entry</gi>.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence of making the use of <gi>sense</gi> more systematic within <gi>entry</gi>, we have seen (see section on <gi>entry</gi>) that some elements are no longer allowed
                        as children of <gi>entry</gi>. We provide here a specific background for each of them:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item><gi>def</gi> is clearly intended to provide a prose description of a meaning within a <gi>sense</gi> element and should not appear in any other context;</item>
                        <item>In the same way, it is recommended that <gi>cit</gi> be used exclusively as a child of <gi>sense</gi>, or when necessary within <gi>dictScrap</gi>;</item>
                        <item>The case of <gi>hom</gi> is peculiar since it provides a subordinate organization to an entry which is redundant in relation to what <gi>sense</gi> allows one to
                            represent. <gi>hom</gi> is not allowed in TEI Lex-0.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Note: In the case one has to deal with information that does not fit a <gi>sense</gi>-based organization, for instance in the process of retro-digitizing an existing dictionary
                        source, the use of <gi>dictScrap</gi> is recommended. Further step in the encoding of the lexical content may lead to a more precise encoding in a second phase.</p>
                    <p>In TEI Lex-0, <gi>sense</gi> has a mandatory <att>xml:id</att>.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>A limited number of possible contexts for <gi>def</gi></head>
                    <p>In the current TEI guidelines, <gi>def</gi> is allowed to be used within the following elements:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>Module core: <gi>cit</gi></item>
                        <item>Module dictionaries: <gi>dictScrap</gi>, <gi>entry</gi>, <gi>entryFree</gi>, <gi>etym</gi>, <gi>hom</gi>, <gi>re</gi>, <gi>sense</gi></item>
                        <item>Module namesdates: <gi>nym</gi></item>
                    </list>
                    <p>TEI Lex-0 allows the use of <gi>def</gi> in <gi>sense</gi>, <gi>cit</gi> and <gi>etym</gi> only. All other existing contexts would be implemented by embedding <gi>def</gi>
                        within a <gi>sense</gi>.</p>

                    <p>Making a clear difference between a situation where an entry has to be split into two or more homonyms and one where these differences correspond to a semantic alternation is
                        lexicographically difficult. Still, the main danger in keeping both possibilities in the representation of a lexical entry in a digital lexicon is to introduce a systematic
                        structural ambiguity as to where the appropriate information is to be found. We thus deprecate <gi>hom</gi> altogether in the present recommendation and have this element be
                        replaced by the appropriate <gi>sense</gi> construct. For instance, the following example from the TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>:</p>

                <p>The current TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi> allows for an extremely wide range of encoding possibilities for written and spoken forms. In the discussion which follows, we
                    suggest ways in which the elements, in particular <gi>form</gi>, can be constrained. We give examples of use types not covered by the <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>, and propose
                    some extensions.</p>

                    <p>We assume that in order to determine the complete properties of an element inside the entry tree, the principle of default inheritance applies, e.g. grammatical properties of a
                        form are determined by collecting the sibling <gi>gramGrp</gi> of the ancestor-or-self of the focus element, where the superordinate grammatical properties can be overwritten
                        by the lower-level properties. This principle is relatively straightforward in the case of grammatical properties, but more complex for the word paradigm, esp. in cases of
                        variant forms. For more information c.f. Ide et al. (<ref target="https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/Publications/2000-IdeKilgRomary-Euralex.pdf"><hi>2000</hi></ref>) and Erjavec et

                    <p>The other use case for paradigms is when the full inflectional paradigm of the word is embedded in the entry, i.e. when the dictionary also includes all the word-forms of the

                    <p>An entry may contain several paradigms, e.g. a partial one for humans and a full one for machines, or one for each stem of a verb. Each paradigm type should be distinguished by

                        <p> In the following example from Mixtepec-Mixtec, there is variation in the form of the word for the city of Oaxaca between speakers from the village of Yucanany and the rest
                            of the speakers. Since the Yucanany variety makes up only a small portion of the speakers of the language, this case of variation is represented as an embedded

                            of the private language subtag (<code>xml:lang="mix-x-YCNY"</code>) as per <ref>BCP 47</ref>.</p>

                    <p>The current TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi> provide several mechanisms by means of which one item of lexical information can refer to another, e.g.:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item><gi>gloss</gi> for the provision of simple (non refined) translation equivalents of the head word</item>
                        <item><tag>usg type="synonym"&gt;</tag> for synonym references</item>
                        <item><code>cit[@type="translation"]/quote</code> for translation equivalents in bilingual or translation dictionaries</item>
                        <item><gi>oRef</gi>, <gi>pRef</gi> for the resolution of “~" headword placeholders in quotations and other dictionary text</item>
                        <item><gi>xr</gi>, <gi>ref</gi> as a general cross-referencing mechanism</item>
                        <item><gi>ptr</gi> as a pointer to another location </item>
                        <item><gi>link</gi></item>
                        <item><gi>mentioned</gi> in the etymology section</item>
                        <item><gi>term</gi> for mentions of technical terms</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In keeping with the approach of the TEI Lex-0, and considering that links/relations between lexical data elements are increasingly part of the core lexical data model rather
                        than mere convenience pointers for dictionary users, we need a more unified and more constrained mechanism for lexical references, whether they point to an existing lexical
                        entity in some dictionary or lexicon, or in a more general way to lexical objects without a target reference. </p>
                    <p>The proposed mechanism has the following properties </p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item>It applies only to references with a clear <hi xml:space="preserve" rend="italic">linguistic</hi> meaning.</item>
                        <item>The number of arbitrary (or context-dependent) choices for the encoder is minimal; the semantics of the reference should not depend on context</item>
                        <item>The relation between the encoding dictionary content and the underlying/implied lexical data model should be as transparent as possible</item>
                        <item>No drastic changes to the TEI guidelines are needed, except for minor changes within the dictionary module</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In the following we first present the recommended encoding, and then elicit how existing alternatives can be replaced accordingly.</p>

                    <head>Using <gi>ref</gi> and <gi>xr</gi> to point to lexical entities</head>
                    <p>In TEI Lex-0, we use <gi>ref</gi> as the general element for a lexical reference and <gi>xr</gi> as the enclosing element that groups information related to this reference. The
                        reference may be internal to a dictionary or pointing to an external source, even when the actual target lexical object is not explicitly known. In the latter case,
                            <gi>ref</gi> can be used without an explicit pointing attribute. Furthermore the actual intended target of the reference can be of various possible types, namely a full
                        entry, but also a specific sense, form or morpheme within a given entry.</p>
                    <p>For all such uses, the following attributes may be used on <gi>xr</gi> and <gi>ref</gi>:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item><att>type</att> is a mandatory attribute on <gi>xr</gi> for a lexical reference. Its default value is "lexical". It should be an indication of the lexical relation
                            between the headword of the entry and the object referred to (cf. next subsection) </item>
                        <item><code>ref/@type</code> may be an indication of the target object category (entry, sense).</item>
                        <item><att>xml:lang</att>, which is <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>recommended<?oxy_custom_end?> when <gi>ref</gi> actually contains an

                        <item><code>ref/@target</code>: to point to the actual lexical object being pointed at when applicable</item>
                        <item><code>ref/@notation</code> to indicate, like we currently do on <gi>orth</gi> or <gi>pron</gi> the actual notation used for the explicit lexical form when provided</item>
                    </list>

                <p>In the current TEI guidelines, <gi>usg</gi> is defined as an element which marks up “usage information in a dictionary entry”. Prototypically, usage information is a label which can
                    be attached at various points in the entry hierarchy in order to signal e. g. restrictions in terms of geographic regions, domains of specialized language or stylistic properties
                    for the particular lexical item that it is attached to.</p>

                    <p>Consider, for instance, the following senses taken from a German entry for Pflaume “plum” where usage information is provided by labels taken from fixed sets of values for

                    <p>In contrast to the example above, the following sample features an occurrence of a more verbose usage description that does not rely on a fixed vocabulary. The sample is taken
                        from a Serbian dialect dictionary. The quote in the dialect is further qualified by a usage hint: “(said by a peasant woman in the field in hot weather)” which provides a
                        particular context in which the quote was recorded.</p>

                        <item>Without <att>type</att> attribute, <gi>usg</gi> would be an underspecified element. Usage labels describe a wide range of linguistic phenomena. Classifying them should be
                            considered a good practice.</item>
                        <item>Currently, the TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi> contain an overuse of <gi>usg</gi> for describing phenomena that could be covered by alternative, more narrowly
                            defined TEI elements. It should be considered a good practice to use the most specific TEI element available. See table above and the next section <ref
                                target="#RestristingUsg">Restricting the scope of <gi>usg</gi></ref></item>
                        <item>It is good practice to normalize the values of the <gi>usg</gi> elements because dictionaries are not always consistent in the way they use their usage labels. For
                            instance, abbreviated and unabbreviated labels can appear in the same dictionary: they should be normalized to a single value. Normalization should be only restricted to a
                            single dictionary. A global normalization effort is currently beyond the scope of TEI Lex-0.</item>
