        <head>General remarks</head>
        <p>In the current TEI Dictionary Chapter, the content model of <gi>entry</gi> allows one to
            have sense-related information directly within <gi>entry</gi>. TEI Lex-0 proscribes a
            stricter use of these elements so that sense-related information is grouped within the
                <gi>sense</gi> element, in accordance with the underlying semasiological model
            implemented in the TEI <hi rend="italic">Guidelines</hi>.</p>
        <p><gi>sense</gi> should be therefore considered mandatory for any dictionary entry that
            actually provides sense information for the headword. Further in this document, we
            consider some additional specific cases e.g. “referencing” entries (entries that simply
            point to other entries) and inflectional lexica (dictionaries that describe word forms
            only), where <gi>sense</gi> is not a mandatory child of <gi>entry</gi>.</p>
        <p>As a consequence of making the use of <gi>sense</gi> more systematic within
                <gi>entry</gi>, we have seen (see section on <gi>entry</gi>) that some elements are
            no longer allowed as children of <gi>entry</gi>. We provide here a specific background
            for each of them:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
            <item><gi>def</gi> is clearly intended to provide a prose description of a meaning
                within a <gi>sense</gi> element and should not appear in any other context;</item>
            <item>In the same way, it is recommended that <gi>cit</gi> be used exclusively as a
                child of <gi>sense</gi>, or when necessary within <gi>dictScrap</gi>;</item>
            <item>The case of <gi>hom</gi> is peculiar since it provides a subordinate organization
                to an entry which is redundant in relation to what <gi>sense</gi> allows one to
                represent. <gi>hom</gi> is not allowed in TEI Lex-0.</item>
        </list>
        <p>Note: In the case one has to deal with information that does not fit a
            <gi>sense</gi>-based organization, for instance in the process of retro-digitizing an
            existing dictionary source, the use of <gi>dictScrap</gi> is recommended. Further step
            in the encoding of the lexical content may lead to a more precise encoding in a second
            phase.</p>
        <p>In TEI Lex-0, <gi>sense</gi> has a mandatory <att>xml:id</att>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <head>Limiting contexts for <gi>def</gi></head>
        <p>In the current <hi rend="italic">TEI Guidelines</hi>, <gi>def</gi> is allowed within the
            following elements:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
            <item>Module core: <gi>cit</gi></item>
            <item>Module dictionaries: <gi>dictScrap</gi>, <gi>entry</gi>, <gi>entryFree</gi>,
                    <gi>etym</gi>, <gi>hom</gi>, <gi>re</gi>, <gi>sense</gi></item>
            <item>Module namesdates: <gi>nym</gi></item>
        </list>
        <p>TEI Lex-0 allows the use of <gi>def</gi> in <gi>sense</gi> only. All other existing
            contexts would be implemented by embedding <gi>def</gi> within a <gi>sense</gi>. </p>

            <head>Gloss vs. definition?</head>
            <p>In the lexicographic literature, gloss is a rather amorphous category. Zgusta, in his
                classic <hi rend="italic">Manual of Lexicography</hi>
                <ref target="#Zgusta1971">(1971)</ref>, defines it as "any descriptive or
                explanatory note within the entry" which includes "short comments, explanatory
                remarks, semantic characteristics or qualifications" (270). Atkins and Rundell <ref
                    target="#Atkins2008">(2008)</ref> see the gloss as "a more informal explanation
                of the meaning of a multiword expression or example (or even part of one) in the
                entry,[...] chiefly used in monolingual dictionaries for learners, to help
                understanding" (209). While one could argue about the statement that this type of
                lexicographic construct is used "chiefly... in monolingual dictionaries for
                learners", it is certainly the case that glosses are expected to help users better
                understand or more easily locate the particular meaning of a word that they are
                looking up. </p>
            <p>In other words, the prototypical gloss contextualizes and clarifies the meaning of
                the word. Take this example from Zgusta: <list type="ordered">
                    <item><hi rend="bold">fugitive</hi> (of persons)</item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">fugitive</hi> (verses)</item>
                </list> Here, glosses are used to signal the meaning of <hi rend="bold"
                    >fugitive</hi>: in the first sense "fugitive" refers to persons, and in the
                second example, to verses. In TEI Lex-0, this could be represented as:
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <entry xml:id="ED.fugitive" xml:lang="en">
                    <form type="lemma">
                        <orth>fugitive</orth>
                    </form>
                    <sense n="1">
                        <gloss>(of persons)</gloss>
                    </sense>
                    <sense n="2">
                        <gloss>(verses)</gloss>
                    </sense>
                </entry>
            </egXML>
                Glosses, however, are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> definitions: one can imagine the
                above two senses to contain proper lexicographic definitions as well:
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <entry xml:id="ED.fugitive" xml:lang="en">
                    <form type="lemma">
                        <orth>fugitive</orth>
                    </form>
                    <sense n="1">
                        <gloss>(of persons)</gloss>
                        <def>given to, or in the act of, running away from a place, especially to avoid arrest or persecution.</def>
                    </sense>
                    <sense n="2">
                        <gloss>(verses)</gloss>
                        <def>concerned or dealing with subjects of passing interest; ephemeral, occasional.</def>
                    </sense>
                </entry>
            </egXML>Zgusta
                notes a certain amount of overlapping between glosses and other categories, "the
                most important probably being that of the examples" (ibid.) This is especially
                evident in sense no. 2 above where "fugitive verses" or "~ verses" could have been
                used as an example. The absence of the lemma or lemma reference in "(verses)" as
                well as the brackets are a clear indicator that the whole construct is not to be
                read as an example, but rather as a semantic signpost for the given sense. </p>

            <head>Glossing examples</head>
            <p>Semantic glosses can occur at different levels of the entry hierarchy. In the
                previous section, we saw examples in which glosses were used as a kind of semantic
                shorthand for an individual sense. They can, however, be used to further qualify
                individual examples in the entry. Take, for instance, this entry from the Longman
                Dictionary of Contemporary English <ref target="#LDOCE2003">(2003)</ref>:</p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">living</hi> /... / adj <hi rend="bold">1</hi> alive now [...] | <hi
                    rend="italic">The sun affects all <hi rend="bold">living</hi> things</hi>
                (=people, animals, and plants). | <hi rend="italic">A <hi rend="bold">living</hi>
                    language </hi> (=one that people still use) [….] </p>
            <p>In TEI Lex-0, this entry would be represented as:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" source="#LDOCE2003">
               <xi:include href="../TEILex0.examples/examples.stripped.xml" corresp="../TEILex0.examples/examples.xml" xpointer="LDOCE.living"/>

        <head>Grammatical properties</head>
        <p>In some dictionaries, individual dictionary senses may be associated with grammatical
            properties, such as part of speech or gender, that differ from the rest of the entry:
            for instance, a particular sense of a countable noun may be used only in plural. In such
            cases, <gi>gramGrp</gi> will be naturally placed inside the given <gi>sense</gi>: </p>
        <p>Consider, for instance, the second sense of this entry:</p>

        <div xml:id="grammatical-glosses">
            <head>Grammatical glosses? </head>
            <p>Zgusta also uses "gloss" to describe "grammatical indications in the broadest sense
                of the word" <ref target="#Zgusta1971"> (1971, 240)</ref>, using an example familiar
                from Latin (and many other) dictionaries: <list type="ordered">
                    <item><hi rend="bold">petere</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">aliquid ab aliquo</hi> [to ask <hi rend="italic">for
                            something from somebody</hi>] </item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">petere</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">Romam</hi> [to rush <hi rend="italic">to Rome</hi>]</item>
                </list>
            </p>
            <p>In theory, one could choose to encode such phenomena using <gi>gloss</gi>, but TEI
                Lex-0 recommends a clear separation of roles: <gi>gloss</gi> should be used for semantic
                or pragmatic information, whereas grammatical information should be encoded using
                the familiar <code rend="language-xpath">gramGrp/gram</code> constructs: </p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                <sense n="1" xml:id="LD.peto.1">
                    <gramGrp>
                        <gram type="rection">aliquid ab aliquo</gram>
                    </gramGrp>
                </sense>
                <sense n="1" xml:id="LD.peto.2">
                    <gramGrp>
                        <gram type="rection">Romam</gram>
                    </gramGrp>
                </sense>
            </egXML>
            <p>Here, too, it is important to note the possibility of ambiguity: unlike "petere
                aliquid ab aliquo", "petere Romam" could be interpreted as an example. The decision
                on such ambiguous cases should never be taken in isolation: editors of a digital
                edition need to consider the conventions of the dictionary as a whole before
                advising encoders on how to mark up such ambiguous cases. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="nested-entries-vs-multiple-senses">
            <head>Nested entries vs. multiple senses</head>
            <p>While TEI Lex-0 has been created to simplify the choices available for encoding
                various lexicographic components, certain levels of ambiguity remain, often due to
                the highly condensed nature of dictionary content.</p>
            <p>Consider, for instance, this entry: <figure>
                    <graphic url="https://i.imgur.com/LlL0H4l.jpg"/>
                </figure>
            </p>
            <p>Is this an entry with two senses? Or are these two entries that were on the account
                of typographic density merged into one?</p>
            <p>The answer is as much in the eyes of the beholder, as it is in the eyes of the
                lexicographers behind the dictionary that the entry stems from, in this case <title
                    rend="italic">The Chambers Dictionary</title>. Both the encoder <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> lexicographers, however, are influenced by lexicographic
                and linguistic traditions in which they operate. For an overview of the
                homonymy-polysemy dilemma, see, for instance, <ref target="#Zöfgen1989">Zöfgen
                    1989</ref>. </p>
            <p>It can't be stressed enough that the goal of dictionary encoding is not to resolve
                linguistic disputes or evaluate lexicographic traditions but rather to create
                consistent, if abstracted, representations of lexicographic architectures. </p>
            <p>So, what can we do in this particular case? Should we encode <hi rend="bold"
                    >gash</hi> as an entry consisting of senses, each with a different part of
                speech, like this:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="gash-as-grammatical-homonyms">
                        <xi:include href="../TEILex0.examples/examples.stripped.xml" corresp="../TEILex0.examples/examples.xml" xpointer="CHDOEL.gash2"/>
                    </egXML>
            <p>This is surely valid TEI Lex-0. There is conceptually nothing wrong with this
                encoding: it adequately represents the structure implied by the source text.</p>
            <p> We should, however, try to look at the issue at hand from a broader, comparative,
                perspective.</p>
            <list>
                <item>In the Portuguese polysemous entry <hi rend="bold">antepassado</hi>
                    <ref target="#antepassado-gramGrp-in-sense">above</ref>, we had a case in which
                    one particular sense (used in plural only) deviated from the other senses (which
                    are used in both singular and plural). Since the senses were numbered in the
                    original, there was never any doubt about how we would encode this. It was clear
                    from the outset: <list>
                        <item>that the semantic information in that entry was grouped by a construct
                            called <gi>sense</gi>;</item>
                        <item>that senses inherited grammatical properties from the entry as a whole
                            (i.e. <code rend="language-xpath">entry/gramGrp</code>);</item>
                        <item>that, implicitly, we could assume that each sense can be used with the
                            noun in both singular and plural; and</item>
                        <item>that the plural-only sense was grammatically exceptional, hence <code
                                rend="language-xpath">entry/sense/gramGrp/</code>).</item>
                    </list>
                </item>
                <item>The English example is different: <hi rend="b">gash</hi> as a verb and as a
                    noun are grammatical homonyms. If we encode them, as we did <ref
                        target="#gash-as-grammatical-homonyms">above</ref>, as two senses within one
                    entry, we end up with an entry in which there is no inheritance (of grammatical
                    properties) and only exceptions (at each sense-level). </item>
            </list>
            <p>Because TEI Lex-0 is aimed at creating a baseline encoding to facilitate data
                exchange and comparison between different dictionaries, we, therefore, recommend to
                encode grammatical homonyms in TEI Lex-0 as nested entries and to use
                    <gi>gramGrp</gi> in <gi>sense</gi> constructs to mark up sense-specific
                deviations from the rule of grammatical inheritance. </p>
            <p>For that reason, our preferred encoding of <hi rend="bold">gash</hi> as a verb and a
                noun would be:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <xi:include href="../TEILex0.examples/examples.stripped.xml" corresp="../TEILex0.examples/examples.xml" xpointer="CH.gash2"/>
                </egXML>
            <p>For an example in which grammatical homonyms have themselves multiple senses, one of
                which is grammatically constrained, see, for instance: </p>
