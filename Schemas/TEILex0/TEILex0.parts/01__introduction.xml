    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>Achieving consistent encoding within a given community of practice has been a recurrent issue
        for the TEI Guidelines. The topic is of particular importance for lexical data if we think
        of the potential wealth of content we could gain from pooling together the information
        available in the variety of highly structured, historical and contemporary lexical
        resources. Still, the encoding possibilities offered by the Dictionaries Chapter in the
        Guidelines are too numerous and too flexible to guarantee sufficient interoperability and a
        coherent model for searching, visualising or enriching multiple lexical resources.</p>
    <p>Following the spirit of TEI Analytics [Zillig, 2009], developed in the context of the MONK
        project, <hi rend="bold">TEI Lex-0</hi> aims at establishing a baseline encoding and a
        target format to facilitate the interoperability of heterogeneously encoded lexical
        resources. This is important both in the context of building lexical infrastructures as such
            <ref type="cit" target="#Ermolaev2012">[Ermolaev and Tasovac 2012]</ref> and in the
        context of developing generic TEI-aware tools such as dictionary viewers and profilers. </p>
    <p>TEI Lex-0 should not be thought of as a replacement of the Dictionary Chapter in the TEI
        Guidelines or as the format that must be used for editing or managing individual resources,
        especially in those projects and/or institutions that already have established workflows
        based on their own flavors of TEI. TEI Lex-0 should be primarily seen as a format that
        existing TEI dictionaries can be univocally transformed to in order to be queried,
        visualised, or mined in a uniform way. At the same time, however, there is no reason why TEI
        Lex-0 could not or should not be used as a best-practice example in educational settings or
        as a set of best-practice guidelines for new TEI-based projects, especially considering the
        fact that in TEI Lex-0 we aimed to stay as aligned as possible with the TEI subset developed
        in conjunction with the revision of the ISO LMF (Lexical Markup Framework) standard (cf.
        [Romary, 2015])</p>

        <head>Context</head>
        <p>Preliminary work for the establishment of TEI Lex-0 started in the Working Group
            "Retrodigitised Dictionaries" lead by Toma Tasovac and Vera Hildenbrandt as part of the
            COST Action <ref target="http://www.elexicography.eu">European Network of
                e-Lexicography</ref> (ENeL). Upon the completion of the COST Action, the work on TEI
            Lex-0 was taken up by the DARIAH Working Group "Lexical Resources" which is co-chaired
            by Laurent Romary and Toma Tasovac. Currently, the work on TEI Lex-0 is conducted by the
            DARIAH WG "Lexical Resources" and the H2020-funded <ref target="https://elex.is"
                >European Lexicographic Infrastructure</ref> (ELEXIS). </p>

        <head>Dictionary model vs. XML serialization</head>
        <p>A fundamental principle that the present enterprise relies on is the nature of the
            mapping of the physical or “near-physical” (OCR-ed) dictionary contents onto the
            abstract model of a dictionary structure, and the mapping from said model onto its (in
            our case) TEI XML serialization. It is important to keep in mind the distinction between
            the abstract model and its serialization because, as we shall see, the TEI uses the same
            elements of the abstract model to serve many kinds of text-modelling tasks, and
            standardly employs ‘features’ or ‘facets’ of these elements (known in the XML world as
            attributes) to express differences among them. The fact that some elements of the
            serialization have names closely corresponding to what we can customarily find in the
            dictionary model is more or less a lucky coincidence. It is not the pattern to be
            expected. A lexicographer coming from outside of the TEI universe should not necessarily
            expect his or her customary terms (names of dictionary objects in the dictionary model)
            to be straightforwardly reflected in the TEI vocabulary names.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the TEI element <gi>cit</gi>. Originally, its TEI name came from the
            word “citation” and this is what the element was used for up to the early days of TEI
            P5, when it acquired a new, broader function of grouping together pieces of text
            perceived or broadly treated as “foreign” or additional, together with their
            (bibliographic, linguistic, or usage-oriented) description. This element is nowadays
            used as a “container” for citations, dictionary examples, translation equivalents etc.
            The value of the attribute <att>type</att> is used to further specify the kind of
            cit-object at hand. In our case, four distinct names of dictionary objects in the
            abstract dictionary model (namely, “citation”, “example”, “translation” (of quotes) and
            “translation equivalent” (of words) map onto four distinct element+attribute
            combinations in the TEI XML serialization (respectively, <gi>cit</gi> with
                <att>type</att>="citation", <gi>cit</gi> with <att>type</att>="example", and
                <gi>cit</gi> with <att>type</att>="translation" or
            <att>type</att>="translationEquivalent".</p>
        <p>The following example from a bilingual dictionary, shows how one typed element –
                <gi>cit</gi> – can be used to encode different parts of the dictionary
            structure:</p>
