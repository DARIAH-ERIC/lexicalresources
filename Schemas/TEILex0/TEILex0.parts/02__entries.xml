      <head>General remarks</head>
      <p>An <gi>entry</gi> is a basic reference unit in a dictionary: it groups together all the
         information related to a particular lemma. For instance:</p>
      <list type="examples">
         <item>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" source="#OALD1974">
               <xi:include href="../TEILex0.examples/examples.stripped.xml" corresp="../TEILex0.examples/examples.xml" xpointer="OALD.competitor"/>
            </egXML>
         </item>

      <head>Mandatory attributes</head>
      <p>The TEI Lex-0 schema prescribes two mandatory attributes on <gi>entry</gi>:</p>
      <list>
         <item><att>xml:id</att>
            <hi rend="italic">uniquely</hi> identifies the element it is associated with;</item>
         <item><att>xml:lang</att> identifies the object language of the element it is associated
            with.</item>
      </list>
      <p>In XML, <att>xml:lang</att> is inherited from the immediately enclosing element or from its
         closest ancestor that has this attribute. This means that in XML not every element needs to
         have the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. </p>
      <p>TEI Lex-0 recommends that <att>xml:lang</att> be attached to so-called container elements
         (such as <gi>entry</gi> and <gi>cit</gi>) rather than individual <gi>form</gi> elements. </p>
      <p>In addition, TEI Lex-0 privileges <code>&lt;entry></code> as the dictioanry's central
         textual component by requiring both a uniqe identifier (<att>xml:id</att>) as well as
            <att>xml:lang</att>. </p>

            <p><att>xml:lang</att> identifies the object language of the element it is associated
               with. The language ‘tag’ (i.e. the value of this attribute) must follow <ref
                  target="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">IETF BCP 47</ref>, the
               Internet Engineering Task Force's best-practice document outlining standard
               identifiers for labeling language content. To learn more about what language tag is
               appropriate for your project, check out W3C's useful resource on <ref
                  target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags.en"
                  >choosing language tags</ref>. </p>
            <p>If the language or language variety you are working on are not defined in BCP 47,
               make sure to follow the syntax of Private Use Tags described in BCP 47 <ref
                  target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.7">Section 2.2.7</ref> when
               creating one. Do this only if you are absolutely certain that no standard tag exists
               for your object language. </p>
            <p>If you have created a "private" language tag, you can validate it (in terms of its
               structural well-formedness and validity) using <ref
                  target="https://schneegans.de/lv/"> BCP 47 validator</ref>.</p>

      <head>Deprecated entry-like elements</head>
      <p>The current TEI Guidelines define five different container elements that may serve as
         grouping devices for entry-level lexical information:</p>
      <list>
         <item><gi>entry</gi>: contains a single <hi rend="italic">structured entry</hi> in any kind
            of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon.</item>
         <item><gi>entryFree</gi>: contains a single <hi rend="italic">unstructured entry</hi> in
            any kind of lexical resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon.</item>
         <item><gi>superEntry</gi>: groups a sequence of entries within any kind of lexical
            resource, such as a dictionary or lexicon which function as a single unit, for example a
            set of homographs.</item>
         <item><gi>re</gi>: (related entry) contains a dictionary entry for a lexical item related
            to the headword, such as a compound phrase or derived form, embedded inside a larger
            entry.</item>
         <item><gi>hom</gi>: (homograph) groups information relating to one homograph within an
            entry</item>
      </list>


      <p>These five elements can be used to distinguish differet types of entries along two
         conceptual axes:</p>
      <list>
         <item>Structured vs. unstructured entries, i. e. entries that can readily be represented
            (in the lexical view) in the spirit of the TEI Guideline’s Dictionary Chapter
               (<gi>entry</gi>, <gi>re</gi>) vs. entries that for some reason violate the generic
            content model of <gi>entry</gi> or <gi>re</gi> and thus have to be represented more
            freely (<gi>entryFree</gi>). A third category in this respect are entries that exhibit a
            highly reduced amount of lexical content while this content is still of essentially
            entry-like nature (<gi>superEntry</gi>). </item>
         <item>Containing vs. contained entries: entries may contain additional lexical information
            that can be conceived as an additional dictionary entry in its own right. Specifically,
               <gi>superEntry</gi> may contain <gi>entry</gi>, and <gi>entry</gi> in turn may
            contain <gi>re</gi> to represent the embedding of lexical entries on three distinct
            levels. Due to <gi>re</gi> being allowed to be used recursively, the number of levels
            for representing entry-like lexical information inside other such blocks is effectively
            unrestricted. At the same time, two different mechanism can be used to create
            homographic entries: <gi>superEntry</gi> containing multiple <gi>entry</gi> elements; or
               <gi>entry</gi> containing multiple <gi>hom</gi> elements. </item>
      </list>
