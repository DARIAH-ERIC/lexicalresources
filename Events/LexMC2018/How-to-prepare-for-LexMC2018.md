# How to Prepare for LexMC2018?

## Bring your own laptop

Since we will have numerous hands-on sessions, it is important that you come with your own laptop with all the necessary software installed  (see below), as well as the data you want to work on. Eduroam is available in the Academy. If you don’t have access to eduroam please inform us as soon as possible.

## Prepare a short presentation of your project

We will start on Monday with a lunch followed by a round of presentations from all the participants. For the presentations, we will use a version of the Ignite Talk model: each participant will have 3 minutes to present themselves, the general background of the project, the data they want to work on and their objectives.

Please download the Powerpoint template from https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/lexicalresources/raw/master/Events/LexMC2018/Resources/Ignite_Talk_LexMC2018_template.ppt. **Rename the file on your computer as LastName_FirstName_Igniter.ppt.** The presentation consists of a title slide and 12 timed slides (15 seconds each), which gives you 3 minutes for the whole presentation. Once you start the presentation, you can’t go back or fast-forward to the next slide.

If you want one slide to last longer than 15 seconds, copy the contents from one slide to the next.

Send us your presentations via email by 8pm on Sunday, December 2.

Please, practice your presentation ahead of time, especially if you are not used to self-timed presentations.

## Reading

As a shared cultural background, try to read the TEI Dictionaries chapter: http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html

Identify the specific difficulties you have with it so that we can provide the adequate input as necessary.

## GitHub Account

We will be collecting all our data samples and other resources on Github inside our https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/lexicalresources repository. If you don’t have a personal GitHub account yet, please make sure you create one _prior_ to the masterclass.

To create a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/join and follow the steps. Choose to create a free account.

## GitHub Desktop App

To facilitate the use of GitHub, especially for those of you have not used it before, make sure you install the GitHub Desktop app for your operating system from https://desktop.github.com/.

Set up the GitHub Desktop app using your personal GitHub account (see above).

## Blogging

For recording our activities during the week, we’ll be asking participants and trainers to contribute blog posts posts on http://digilex.hypotheses.org

You will soon be receiving an invitation from hypothesis.org to join DigiLex as a contributor. Please click on the link in the invitation email to activate your user account.

For those who may have the time, you could prepare a first post providing a general presentation of your project.

## GROBID-Dictionaries (PDF2TEI)
GROBID-Dictionaries is the first machine learning infrastructure for structuring digitised dictionaries into TEI-compliant resources. The system’s architecture relies on a cascading approach for information extraction from textual information in PDF documents (digital born or OCRised). The implemented pluggable models in GROBID-Dictionaries have shown enough flexibility to be be applicable on a wide range of entry-based documents containing lexical or encyclopaedic information, from dictionaries to address directories. The usability has been also enhanced also to ease the setup and the training of the system.

The goal of GROBID-Dictionaries workshop is to get familiar with the training process of each model of the infrastructure and to learn how to use them to speed up drastically the encoding of own lexical samples in TEI. For more details, you could have a look on these papers:

For those of you who are interested to use the tool for their own material, please send some pdf samples to [Mohamed Khemakhem](mohamed.khemakhem@inria.fr).

## oXygen XML

oXygen has kindly supported us with the provision of a 6 month license for all participants. Unless you already have your own oXygen license, please install Oxygen XML Editor from https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html

and use the license key that you will have received from us by email.
