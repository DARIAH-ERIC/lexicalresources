# From Print to Screen: The Theory and Practice of Digitizing Dictionaries

This course is part of the 5th LISBON SUMMER SCHOOL IN LINGUISTICS, taking place from 2-6 July 2018 at the NOVA University School of Social Sciences and Humanities.

It will introduce the theory and practice of converting print dictionaries into electronic form as a basis for exploring broader questions about the very nature of dictionaries as both tools and cultural artifacts. We will study lexical data modeling, in general, and Text Encoding Initiative, in particular, as a way of representing complex dictionary structures. We will discuss the relationship between the structural encoding of dictionary data and the functionalities of electronic dictionaries. At the end of the course, the participants should have a fundamental understanding of how to analyze, identify and describe dictionary data in order to query it or share it with others.

Instructor: Toma Tasovac
