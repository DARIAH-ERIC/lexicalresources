# Housekeeping matters

## Send your dictionary data to the instructor (not optional)

Don't forget to email your scanned dictionary data to the instructor.

## Bring your own laptop (optional)

Since we will have numerous hands-on sessions, you may want to bring your own laptop with the necessary software installed  (see below) starting Wednesday.

You can also use the computers available in the lab.

## Install oXygen XML (if you are bringing your own laptop)

Unless you already have your own oXygen license, please install Oxygen XML Editor from https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html

Make sure you apply for a 30-day trial license. This requires the use of an email. The license will be mailed to you.
