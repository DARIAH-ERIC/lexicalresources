# How to Prepare for LexMC2017?

## Bring your own laptop

Since we will have numerous hands-on sessions, it is important that you come with your own laptop with all the necessary software installed  (see below), as well as the data you want to work on. Eduroam is available in the Academy. If you don’t have access to eduroam please inform us as soon as possible.

## Prepare a short presentation of your project

We will start on Monday with a round of presentations from all the participants. For the presentations, we will use a version of the Ignite Talk model: each participant will have 3 minutes to present themselves, the general background of the project, the data they want to work on and their objectives.

Please download the Powerpoint template from https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/lexicalresources/raw/master/Events/LexMC2017/Resources/Ignite_Talk_LexMC2017_template.ppt. Rename the file on your computer as LastName_FirstName_Igniter.ppt. The presentation consists of a title slide and 12 timed slides (15 seconds each), which gives you 3 minutes for the whole presentation. Once you start the presentation, you can’t go back or fast-forward to the next slide.

If you want one slide to last longer than 15 seconds, copy the contents from one slide to the next.

Send us your presentations by 8pm on Sunday, December 3.

Please, practice your presentation ahead of time, especially if you are not used to self-timed presentations.

## Reading

As a shared cultural background, try to read the TEI Dictionaries chapter: http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html

Identify the specific difficulties you have with it so that we can provide the adequate input as necessary.

## GitHub Account

We will be collecting all our data samples and other resources on Github inside our brand-new https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/lexicalresources repository. If you don’t have a personal GitHub account yet, please make sure you create one prior to the masterclass.

To create a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/join and follow the steps. Choose to create a free account.

## GitHub Desktop App

To facilitate the use of GitHub, especially for those of you have not used it before, make sure you install the GitHub Desktop app for your operating system from https://desktop.github.com/.

Set up the GitHub Desktop app using your personal GitHub account (see above).

## Blogging

For recording our activities during the week, we’ll be asking participants and trainers to contribute blog posts posts on http://digilex.hypotheses.org

You will soon be receiving an invitation from hypothesis.org to join DigiLex as a contributor. Please click on the link in the invitation email to activate your user account.

For those who may have the time, you could prepare a first post providing a general presentation of your project.

## Twitter

Our hashtag for the week: #lexmc

## PDF2TEI

During the week, those of you who have source material in the form of a “traditional” dictionary will have the opportunity to experiment the automatic extraction of entry structure by means of the GROBID-dictionary software (see https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01508868). For those of you who are interested in principle, please send some pdf samples to Mohamed Khemakhem.

## oXygen XML

oXygen has kindly supported us with the provision of a 6 month license for all participants. Unless you already have your own oXygen license, please install Oxygen XML Editor from https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html

and use the license key that you have received from us by email.

The number of licenses is limited, so please install this license only on the laptop which you will bring to the masterclass.
